                <h3 class="headings">About</h3>
                <p class="summary">In 2011, I graduated from Clemson University with a B.A. in History. While at Clemson, I also took a couple of semesters in Graphic Communication courses. I have always enjoyed drawing and would consider it one of my favorite hobbies. After graduation, I begin volunteering with KidSpring, the children’s ministry at NewSpring Church, and was eventually brought in as a full time staff member. While with KidSpring, I learned to hone and craft my illustration ability under the guidance of two incredible artists. Also, my time at KidSpring was a great experience in working together and collaborating daily on a team of 14. I had heard through a friend about a new coding school that had opened up in Greenville called The Iron Yard. Web development has always been something I have been really interested in. I had a little experience with Wordpress type sites and some basic HTML/CSS, but I wanted to be better. The Iron Yard was just the opportunity I needed to gain some real programming knowledge. So I began class in the Front-end Academy in August 2013. Under the guidance and instruction of great teachers and mentors (Mason Stewart and Eric Dodds), I learned skills and grew as a programmer in ways that I never could have on my own. The Iron Yard also taught me important things like the culture of web development and the best and standard practices in the front-end world. I’m currently looking for an opportunity to continue to grow, improve and expand my developing skills. </p>

                <h3 class="headings">Skills</h3>
                <p class="top-project">The project that I am most proud of is a chat program that I worked on with two other classmates. It was a realtime chatroom where one could choose a username and communicate to any other users also involved in the chat. My main focus was on the front-end design of the site but it was built using Parse as the back-end. However, together the team collaborated on all aspects of the project and as a result was a great learning experience.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4 class="subhead">HTML5/CSS3</h4>
                <p class="markup">I am very confident in my HTML5/CSS skills as a developer. I can mark up any website design to the pixel. I am also able to create responsive sites and have experience with cross-browser compatibility.</p>
                
                <h4 class="subhead">JavaScript</h4>
                <p class="javascript">I have a solid foundation and experience using Javascript and JQuery. I look forward to expanding upon my knowledge across other frameworks. </p>

                <h4 class="subhead">Adobe Creative Suite 6</h4>
                <p class="javascript">During my time with KidSpring, I used Adobe Creative Suite everyday and became very experienced in using and navigating my way through the programs, particularly Illustrator and Photoshop. In comparison to these two, my knowledge is not as extensive but is still fairly solid in Dreamweaver, InDesign and After Effects.</p>
    
                <h4 class="subhead">Parse</h4>
                <p class="parse">I have experience using Parse, as a number of projects I worked on used it as the back-end.</p>
